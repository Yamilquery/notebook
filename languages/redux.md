> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

> It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

> You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.
> It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).
