## Types

### Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)*
> A **domain-specific language** (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application **domain**. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.


### General-Purpose Language

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language)*
> A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain. This is in contrast to a domain-specific language (DSL), which is specialized to a particular application domain.


## Paradigms

Many programming paradigms are as well known for what techniques they forbid as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming disallows the use of side-effects, while structured programming disallows the use of the goto statement.

### Declarative (contrast: imperative)

#### Functional

* Scala


### Structured (contrast: non-structured)

#### Object-oriented

* C++
* Java


### Dynamic

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)*
> a class of high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation.

* Clojure
* JavaScript
* Lua
* Objective-C
* Perl
* PHP
* Python
* R
* Ruby



### Metaprogramming




### Language-oriented

#### Domain-specific (DSL)
