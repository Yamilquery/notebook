## Types

### Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)*

> A **domain-specific language** (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application **domain**. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

### General-Purpose Language

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language)*

> A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain. This is in contrast to a domain-specific language (DSL), which is specialized to a particular application domain.

## Paradigms

Many programming paradigms are as well known for what techniques they forbid as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming disallows the use of side-effects, while structured programming disallows the use of the goto statement.

### Declarative (contrast: imperative)

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)*

> A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

#### Functional

-   Scala

### Structured (contrast: non-structured)

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming)*

> Aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the goto statement which could lead to "spaghetti code" which is difficult both to follow and to maintain.

#### Object-oriented

#### Examples

-   C++
-   Java

### Dynamic

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)*

> a class of high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation.

#### Examples

-   Clojure
-   JavaScript
-   Lua
-   Objective-C
-   Perl
-   PHP
-   Python
-   R
-   Ruby

### Metaprogramming

### Language-oriented

#### Domain-specific (DSL)
