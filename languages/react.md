# React


*From: [Wikipedia]()*

> React is an open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML. React views are typically rendered using components that contain additional components specified as custom HTML tags. React promises programmers a model in which subcomponents cannot directly affect enclosing components ("data flows down"); efficient updating of the HTML document when data changes; and a clean separation between components on a modern single-page application.
