# Yum *(Yellowdog Updater, Modified)*


*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified)*

> An open-source command-line package-management utility for Linux operating systems using the RPM Package Manager.

> Yum allows automatic updates, package and dependency management, on RPM-based distributions. Like the Advanced Package Tool (APT) from Debian, yum works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection.

> Under the hood, yum depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and replaced yum as the default package manager in Fedora 22.
