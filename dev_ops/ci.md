# Continuous Integration

The practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day; adopted by Extreme Program.

## Best practices

-   Maintain a code repository
-   Automate the build
-   Make the build self-testing
-   Everyone commits to the baseline every day
-   Every commit (to baseline) should be built
-   Keep the build fast
-   Test in a clone of the production environment
-   Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
-   Everyone can see the results of the latest build
-   Automate deployment
