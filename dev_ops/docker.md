# Docker

A two part shell/management layer for building and running virtual linux containers, based on LXC.

A tool for deploying and running applications. Docker provides a way to run an application securely isolated in a container in a way that is platform agnostic.

### Image

Read-only template for a docker container.

-   An inert, immutable, file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run.
-   Uses a union file system (UFS) to 'layer' file system branches on top of each other. **Every time a change is made to a Docker image, a new layer is created.**
-   Docker images are built from a set a steps called instructions. These instructions can be built either by executing commands manually or automatically through Dockerfiles.
-   As more layers (tools, applications, etc.) are added on top of the base, new images can be formed by committing these changes â€“ like a version control system!
-   Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com.
-   Because they can become quite large, images are designed to be composed of layers of other images, allowing a miminal amount of data to be sent when transferring images over the network.

#### Commands

Search

```sh
docker search [image_name]
docker pull [image_name]
```

List all images on your system

```sh
docker images
```

Build an image from a dockerfile

```sh
docker build -t NAME_OF_IMAGE [directory where Dockerfile lives] NAME_OF_CONTAINER
```

Commit an image

```sh
sudo docker commit [container ID] IMAGE_NAME
```

Remove

```sh
docker rmi -f IMAGE_ID
```

### Container

A Linux Container, (sort of) like a directory, it holds everything needed for an app to run.

-   Docker containers are essentially directories that can be packed (e.g. tar-archived), then shared and run on other hosts. The only dependency is having docker installed on the hosts.

-   Docker containers allow:

    -   Application portability
    -   Process isolation
    -   Preventing access beyond the container's own filesystem
    -   Lightweight, esp. relative to VMs

-   When everything is self-contained and the risk of system-level changes are eliminated, the container becomes immune to external exposures which could put it out of order (i.e. 'dependency hell').

-   NB: docker depends on a single process to run. When that process stops, the container stops.

-   If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class.

#### Commands

List

```sh
docker ps     # those running
docker ps -l  # both running & dormant
```

Create *(either from an existing image or creating a new one)*

```sh
docker run IMAGE_NAME COMMAND_TO_RUN
docker run my_image echo 'hello'
```

Running

```sh
docker run CONTAINER_ID
docker run IMAGE_NAME COMMAND_TO_RUN
```

Start an interactive shell within your container

```sh
docker run -it IMAGE_NAME /bin/sh
```

Forward port on the host to a port on the container

```sh
docker run --publish 3000:3000 IMAGE_NAME COMMAND_TO_RUN
```

Stopping a container

```sh
docker stop CONTAINER_ID
```

Removing a container

```sh
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```

Attaching yourself to a container *(your console will run commands within the container itself)*

```sh
docker attach CONTAINER_ID
```

Detach the current container: type `^` + `P` followed by `^` + `Q`
