# JSON Web Token (JWT)

An open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

The information is digitally signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.
