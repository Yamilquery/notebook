# DevOps

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)*

> A culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It **aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software, can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably**.
