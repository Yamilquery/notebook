# Gearman

*From: [GearmanHQ](http://gearmanhq.com/help/getting-started/)*

> A generic application framework for doing work in the background, spanning different machines, networks, and workers, each suited to preforming a specific job or set of jobs. Gearman itself acts as the central nervous system: jobs can come in from a variety of source, and workers can be on several machines and running in several different langauges.
