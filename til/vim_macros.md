# Vim Macros

If you want to repeat a bunch of vim commands for running multiple times, record them in a macro and run wherever you want.


## To record a macro:

1. type `q` followed by any char: **[a-z]**
1. type your vim commands
1. type `q` again to finish recording

## To run the macro:

`@` followed by the **same char** you chose to store the macro.
