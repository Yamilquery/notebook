# DiSC Assessment

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment)*

> DISC is a behavior assessment tool based on the DISC theory of psychologist William Moulton Marston, which centers on four different behavioral traits, which today are called: **dominance**, **influence**, **steadiness**, and **compliance**. This theory was then developed into a behavioral assessment tool by industrial psychologist Walter Vernon Clarke. There are many different versions of the questionnaire and assessment. Some date back to the 1940s while others are more recent.

|     **I**nfluence     | Finishing things -- get bored (don't finish). Formal reporting, re-doing things.      |
|    **S**teadiness     | Competition -- someone has to lose. Slow at making big decisions -- averse to change. |
| **C**onscientiousness | Paralysis by analysis -- thorough. Incomplete information confounds.                  |
