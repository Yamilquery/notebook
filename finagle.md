# Finagle

*From: [Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/finagle)*

> Finagle is an extensible RPC system for the JVM, used to construct high-concurrency servers. Finagle implements uniform client and server APIs for several protocols, and is designed for high performance and concurrency. Most of Finagleâ€™s code is **protocol agnostic**, simplifying the implementation of new protocols.

> Finagle is written in Scala, but provides both Scala and Java idiomatic APIs.
