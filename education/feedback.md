## My Experience

* Vulnerability. When giving feedback, approach from a place of vulnerability
* Thank them when you receive it
* Don't respond to feedback with feedback
* If you can't find the flipside positive of a constructive criticism, pause before going forward, there may be a better place for you to come from within yourself before going to the other person.
