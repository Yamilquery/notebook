# Cookies



> So there's two important points here:
>
> * (1) each cookie is only sent back to the same web site as it came from in the first place, and
>
> * (2) the "contents" of the cookie (the data it contains) can only be made up of whatever information the web server already knew anyway.  For example, a web server can't just say "send me a cookie containing your e-mail address" unless that same web server had already sent you that information in the first place.
