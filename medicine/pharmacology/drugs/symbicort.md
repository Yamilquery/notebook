# Symbicort (trade)

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budesonide/formoterol)*

> Budesonide/formoterol is a combination formulation containing budesonide and formoterol used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It contains two active ingredients delivered via a single inhaler:

> -   budesonide, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid which acts by reducing and preventing respiratory tract inflammation
> -   formoterol, a rapid-acting and long-lasting Î²2-agonist which acts by causing bronchodilation

> Budesonide/formoterol is the first combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) that has shown some efficacy as a medicine not only used to prevent asthma attacks, but also provide quick relief of an asthma attack.

> In patients with asthma, budesonide/formoterol formulation for both maintenance and as-needed treatment reduces exacerbations better than as-needed formoterol or as-needed terbutaline. Nevertheless, it is unclear as to whether this strategy is better than increasing a maintenance dose of Symbicort or similar combined inhaler.

> The use for quick relief has been approved by the GINA guidelines 2006 (Evidence A), however Symbicort is indicated in the United States only as a maintenance medication. In March 2009, the FDA approved the use of Symbicort pMDI to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD).
