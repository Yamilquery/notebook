# Zen

> *In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.*

> *~ Suzuki, Shunryu. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.*

*From: [Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen)*
> Zen emphasizes rigorous meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher.
