# Architecture

## Questions to Ask

-   [ ] Is this a “Good Idea”? Feature creep — kill it.
-   [ ] DRY? Do I repeat this anywhere?
-   [ ] Orthogonal? How independent is this?
-   [ ] Testable? How will I test this?
-   [ ] Is there another way? Having only one idea is dangerous
-   [ ] Costs of changing this later
-   [ ] What would the architecture look like if I didn't have this problem?
-   [ ] What are the facts and assumptions?
-   [ ] Document rationale
