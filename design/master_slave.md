# Master/Slave

*From: [Wikipedia]()*

> A model of communication where one device or process has unidirectional control over one or more other devices. In some systems a master is selected from a group of eligible devices, with the other devices acting in the role of slaves.

> In other words "The master/slave configuration is basically used for load sharing purposes when 2 identical motors connected to two different drives are coupled to a common load". One drive is defined as the master and is configured for running in the speed-control mode whereas the other defined as slave is configured for running in torque-control mode.
