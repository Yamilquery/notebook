|   |                           |
|---|---------------------------|
| S | **S**ingle Responsibility |
| O | **O**pen/closed           |
| L | **L**iskov Substitution   |
| I | **I**nterface Segregation |
| D | **D**ependency Inversion  |

## Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only a single responsibility.

## Open/closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification..

## Liskov Substitution Principle

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

> *See also [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract).*

## Interface Segregation Principle

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

> Depend upon Abstractions, not on concretions.
