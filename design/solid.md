# SOLID Principles

A mnemonic acronym that stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design.

-   **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
-   **O**pen/closed Principle
-   **L**iskov Substitution Principle
-   **I**nterface Segregation Principle
-   **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only a single responsibility.

## Open/closed Principle

> “software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

## Liskov Substitution Principle

> “Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.

## Interface Segregation Principle

> “Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

## Dependency Inversion Principle

> One should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”
