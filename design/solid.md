# SOLID Principles

A mnemonic acronym for principles of OOP.

|       Principle       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:---------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Responsibility | A class should have only a single responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                |
|      Open/closed      | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.                                                                                                                                     |
|  Liskov Substitution  | Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. *See also [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract).* |
| Interface Segregation | Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.                                                                                                                                   |
| Dependency Inversion  | Depend upon Abstractions, not on concretions.                                                                                                                                                                    |
