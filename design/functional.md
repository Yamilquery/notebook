# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs, not on what programs we can express.

## Side Effects

A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a result, for example:

-   Modifying a variable
-   Modifying a data structure in place
-   Setting a field on an object
-   Throwing an exception or halting with an error
-   Printing to the console or reading user input
-   Reading from or writing to a file
-   Drawing on the screen
