# Object-Oriented Programming

A programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

## Abstraction

Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.

## Encapsulation

Hide the implementation details of a class from other objects. e.g. Data is accessible only via methods, at least in ruby.

## Inheritance

A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.

## Objects/Classes

An object is a combination of data and methods. In a OOP program, we create objects. These objects communicate together through methods. Each object can receive messages, send messages and process data.

## Polymorphism

The process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input.
