# Immutability

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)*

> In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

Strings and other concrete objects are typically expressed as immutable objects for:

-   improve readability
-   runtime efficiency
-   inherently thread-safe
-   higher security
