# Behavioral Design Patterns

[Source Making][source_making]

> These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| [Chain of Responsibility](./chain_of_responsibility.md) | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects. |
| [Command](./command.md)                                 | Encapsulate a command request as an object.            |
| [Interpreter]()                                         | A way to include language elements in a program.       |
| [Iterator](./iterator.md)                               | Sequentially access the elements of a collection.      |
| [Mediator](./mediator.md)                               | Defines simplified communication between classes.      |
| [Memento](./memento.md)                                 | Capture and restore an object's internal state.        |
| [Null Object]()                                         | Designed to act as a default value of an object.       |
| [Observer](./observer.md)                               | A way of notifying change to a number of classes.      |
| [State](./state.md)                                     | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.     |
| [Strategy](./strategy.md)                               | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.              |
| [Template method](./template.md)                        | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.   |
| [Visitor]()                                             | Defines a new operation to a class without change.     |
