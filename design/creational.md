# Creational Design Patterns

Pertains to class instantiation.

## Types

-   class-creation patterns: use **inheritance** in the instantiation process)
-   object-creational patterns: use **delegation** in the instantiation process)

## Patterns

|                                           |                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Abstract Factory](./abstract_factory.md) | Creates an instance of several families of classes.                                                  |
| [Builder]()                               | Separates object construction from its representation.                                               |
| [Factory Method]()                        | Creates an instance of several derived classes.                                                      |
| [Object Pool]()                           | Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. |
| [Prototype]()                             | A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.                                                 |
| [Singleton](./singleton.md)               | A class of which only a single instance can exist.                                                   |
