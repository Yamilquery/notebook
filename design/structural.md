# Structural Design Patterns

[Source Making][source_making]

> These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

-   [Adapter](./adapter.md): Match interfaces of different classes.
-   [Bridge](./bridge.md): Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation.
-   [Composite](./composite.md): A tree structure of simple and composite objects.
-   [Decorator](./decorator.md): Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
-   [Facade](): A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
-   [Flyweight](./flyweight.md): A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
-   [Private Class Data](): Restricts accessor/mutator access.
-   [Proxy](./proxy.md): An object representing another object.
