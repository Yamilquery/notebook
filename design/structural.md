# Structural Design Patterns

Pertains to composition of Classes and Objects.

-   Structural class-creation patterns use **inheritance** to compose interfaces.
-   Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

## Patterns

|                                 |                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---|
| [**Adapter**](./adapter.md)     | Match interfaces of different classes.                   |
| [**Bridge**](./bridge.md)       | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation. |
| [**Composite**](./composite.md) | A tree structure of simple and composite objects.        |
| [**Decorator**](./decorator.md) | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.             |
| [**Facade**]()                  | A single class that represents an entire subsystem.      |
| [**Flyweight**](./flyweight.md) | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.      |
| [**Private Class Data**]()      | Restricts accessor/mutator access.                       |
| [**Proxy**](./proxy.md)         | An object representing another object.                   |
