# Encapsulation

*<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>*

> In programming languages, encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:

> * A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
> * A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.

> Some programming language researchers and academics use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object-oriented programming, while other programming languages which provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.

> The second definition is motivated by the fact that in many OOP languages hiding of components is not automatic or can be overridden; thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.

> The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist.
