# Binary Search Algorithm

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)*

> a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a **sorted array**. The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomic divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.

| x                           | y        |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Data structure              | Array    |
| Worst case performance      | O(log n) |
| Best case performance       | O(1)     |
| Average case performance    | O(log n) |
| Worst case space complexity | O(1)     |
