# Java Virtual Machine

*From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)*

> A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. There are three notions of the JVM: **specification**, **implementation** and **instance**.

> * **Specification**: a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation. Having a single specification ensures all implementations are interoperable.
> * **Implementation**: a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM specification.
> * **Instance of a JVM**: an implementation running in a process that executes a computer program compiled into Java bytecode.

> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. It includes a Java Virtual Machine implementation together with an implementation of the Java Class Library.

> Java Development Kit (JDK) is a superset of a JRE and contains tools for Java programmers, e.g. a javac compiler.
