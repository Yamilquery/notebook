- [ ] [Francis Beach Campground](http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/half-moon-bay-state-beach/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=CA&parkId=120039)
    * hike/bike campsites are off the parking loop, as are 36-37-38
    * 13-14-15 are more isolated with trees + grassy field for tents
    * 17-19-22-24-26-28-30-32-34 are on the dune above the beach - nothing but sand btw you and the waves
    * > one downside is all of the valley is there on the weekends. You might try weekdays its an entirely different experience. Try the three amigos restaurant on the way out A++!
- [ ] [Steep Ravine Cabins & Campground](http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/mount-tamalpais-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=CA&parkId=120063) *(5 mo?)*
    * Cabins 7/8 closest to water
    * > People go nuts for the cabins, but I personally love the campsites at Steep Ravine better. Great views, and good privacy due to the terrain. Sites 2 & 3 are the best to book for a big group, and are also protected from wind by awesome Cypress trees

    * > Sites 5-7 are the small but offers the most seclusion
