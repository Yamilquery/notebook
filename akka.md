# Akka

–   a toolkit and runtime for developing concurrent, distributed, message-based applications.

  –   _not_ a framework, more properly a library.

---

## Akka provides:

###  Actors

* Asynchronous, non-blocking, message-driven model
* Actors form hierarchies, with parent actors (supervisors) delegating some tasks to child actors.
* > "The quintessential feature of actor systems is that tasks are split up and delegated until they become small enough to be handled in one piece."

###  Fault Tolerance

* 'let-it-crash' philosophy
* Systems are self-healing
