# Glossary

## Behavior-Driven Development

A software development methodology in which an application is specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer.

## Blocks

In Ruby, blocks are closures (anonymous functions) that can be passed to many methods.

## Callbacks

Functions that are executed asynchronously.

## Composer

An application-level package manager for the PHP programming language that provides a standard format for managing dependencies of PHP software and required libraries.

## CRUD

Create. Read. Update. Destroy.

## Curry

See: Currying.

## Currying

The process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes just a single argument and returns another function if any arguments are still needed.

## Delta Compression

See: Delta Encoding.

## Delta Encoding

A way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences (deltas) between sequential data rather than complete files; more generally this is known as data differencing.

## Docker

Docker, a tool for deploying and running applications. Docker provides a way to run an application securely isolated in a container in a way that is platform agnostic. https://docs.docker.com

## Domain-Specific Language

A computer language specialized to a particular application domain.

## Duck Typing

A way to write computer code that doesn't demand that you know what types you are writing about. If it does what you thought it would do, it is good enough. The reason this is called "duck typing" is the duck test: "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck."

## Functional Tests

Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or side-effects, just the result (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z). They are written to test part of the specification such as, "calling function Square(x) with the argument of 2 returns 4".

## General-Purpose Language

A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

## GNU Make

A tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

## Interface

Specifies what methods a class must implement (an interface). An interface is slightly more abstract than an abstract class, because it does not imply an 'is a' relationship with classes that inherit it.

## Kitematic

The Docker GUI, runs on Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. https://docs.docker.com/kitematic/

## Lambda

A closure. More or less identical to PROCS, with a key difference: when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without finishing the calling method.

## Law of Demeter

A given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of "information hiding".

## Lazy Loading

A design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used. The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading.

## LDAP

A directory service protocol that runs on a layer above the TCP/IP stack. It provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories. The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model.

## LDIF

A standard plain text data interchange format for representing LDAP directory CRUD requests.

## Ncurses

A programming library providing an API that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing "GUI-like" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.

## Postgres

See: PostgreSQL.

## PostgreSQL

An object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.

## Private

Accessible only within the class itself.

## Proc

A closure or a "saved block‚Äù. Kind of like a method, but it can be used like a block and passed to methods that take blocks as parameters. & is used to convert a proc into a block.

## Protected

Accessible within the class itself and subclasses.

## Protocol

A defined language machines talk in. Doesn't matter how their brains created or listen to the thoughts, just that the language is agreed upon.

## Public

Accessible everywhere.

## Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Reflection

The ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.

## Repository

A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection

## SEIT

Software Engineer in Test

## Service

A Service in Domain Driven Design is simply a stateless object that performs an action.

## SQLite

 A software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

## Trait

A set of methods that are not inherited, but composed into classes.

## Traits

*see Trait*

## Type introspection

The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.

# X.500

A complex enterprise directory system.
