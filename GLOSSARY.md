## Interfaces

Specifies what methods a class must implement (an interface). An interface is slightly more abstract than an abstract class, because it does not imply an 'is a' relationship with classes that inherit it.

## Protected

Accessible within the class itself and subclasses.

## Public

Accessible everywhere.

## Repository

A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection

## Service

A Service in Domain Driven Design is simply a stateless object that performs an action.

## Traits

Sets of methods that are not inherited, but composed into classes.

## Private

Accessible only within the class itself.
