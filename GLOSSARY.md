# Glossary

## APNs

Apple Push Notification service.

## Backbone

## Behavior-Driven Development

A software development methodology in which an application is specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer.

## Binary Protocol

A protocol which is intended or expected to be read by a machine rather than a human being, as opposed to a plain text protocol such as IRC, SMTP, or HTTP. Binary protocols have the advantage of terseness, which translates into speed of transmission and interpretation.

## Blocks

In Ruby, blocks are closures (anonymous functions) that can be passed to many methods.

## Brevity

Concise and exact use of words in writing or speech.

## Callbacks

Functions that are executed asynchronously.

## CNS

Central Nervous System.

## Comparison Sort

A type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a "less than or equal to" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list.

## Composer

An application-level package manager for the PHP programming language that provides a standard format for managing dependencies of PHP software and required libraries.

## Control Flow

The order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language.

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## CRUD

Create. Read. Update. Destroy.

## Curry

See: Currying.

## Currying

The process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes just a single argument and returns another function if any arguments are still needed.

## Decorator Pattern

Add responsibilities to objects dynamically; a structural design pattern.

## Deep learning

A branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, composed of multiple non-linear transformations.

## Delta Compression

See: Delta Encoding.

## Delta Encoding

A way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences (deltas) between sequential data rather than complete files; more generally this is known as data differencing.

## DIT

Directory Information Tree.

## Divide & conquer algorithm

An algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type (divide), until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer). The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## Domain-Specific Language

A computer language specialized to a particular application domain.

## DRY

Don’t Repeat Yourself, a software design principle. Explained in Pragmatic Programmers, it means that “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.”

## DSE

DSA Specific Entry.

## Duck Typing

A way to write computer code that doesn't demand that you know what types you are writing about. If it does what you thought it would do, it is good enough. The reason this is called "duck typing" is the duck test: "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck."

## Functional Tests

Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or side-effects, just the result (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z). They are written to test part of the specification such as, "calling function Square(x) with the argument of 2 returns 4".

## General-Purpose Language

A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

## GNU Make

A tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

## Hash table

A data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Hash tables

See Hash Table

## Headless

A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface.

## HMAC

Hash-based message authentication code.

## HSTS

HTTP Strict Transport Security, a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. The HSTS Policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an HTTP response header field named "Strict-Transport-Security". HSTS Policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion.

## IANA

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

## IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service.

## ICANN

## jQuery

A cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

## JVM

Java virtual machine, an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance. The specification is a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation.

## Kitematic

The Docker GUI, runs on Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. <https://docs.docker.com/kitematic>

## Lambda

A closure. More or less identical to PROCS, with a key difference: when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without finishing the calling method.

## Law of Demeter

A given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of "information hiding".

## Lazy Loading

A design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used. The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading.

## LDAP

A directory service protocol that runs on a layer above the TCP/IP stack. It provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories. The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model.

## LDIF

A standard plain text data interchange format for representing LDAP directory CRUD requests.

## Machine Learning

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## MapReduce

A programming model & implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. Composed of a Map() method that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a Reduce() method that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The "MapReduce System" orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.

## Ncurses

A programming library providing an API that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing "GUI-like" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.

## Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" which exchange messages between each other. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.

## OID

Object IDentifier.

## OKRs

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a management methodology that connects work to a strategic plan.

## Ontology

The philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. It deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences.

## OSPNS

Operating System Push Notification Service.

## Polymorphism

The provision of a single interface to entities of different types.

## Postgres

See: PostgreSQL.

## PostgreSQL

An object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.

## Proc

A closure or a "saved block”. Kind of like a method, but it can be used like a block and passed to methods that take blocks as parameters. & is used to convert a proc into a block.

## Profiling

A measure of the relative performance of your application at the code-level. Profiling will capture things like CPU usage, memory usage, time and number of calls per function, as well as capturing a call graph. The act of profiling will impact performance. This differs from benchmarking, as benchmarking is performed externally and will measure the actual performance: what your end-users will see.

## Reflection

The ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.

## Repository

A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection

## RPC

Remote Procedure Call, a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer in a network without having to understand network details. (A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.) RPC uses the client/server model.

## RPM

## Trait

A set of methods that are not inherited, but composed into classes.

## Traits

*see Trait*

## Thunk

A subroutine that is created, often automatically, to assist a call to another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to represent an additional calculation that a subroutine needs to execute, or to call a routine that does not support the usual calling mechanism.

## Type introspection

The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.

## UFS

Unionfs is a filesystem service for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD which implements a union mount for other file systems. As an example application of union mounting, consider the need to update the information contained on a CD-ROM or DVD. While a CD-ROM is not writable, one can overlay the CD's mount point with a writable directory in a union mount. Then, updating files in the union directory will cause them to end up in the writable directory, giving the illusion that the CD-ROM's contents have been updated.

## UMT

User multivariate testing, a technique for testing a hypothesis in which multiple variables are modified. The goal of multivariate testing is to determine which combination of variations performs the best out of all of the possible combinations. Websites and mobile apps are made of combinations of changeable elements.

## Union mount

A way of combining multiple directories into one that appears to contain their combined contents.

## UUID

Universally unique identifier, an identifier standard used in software construction. A UUID is simply a 128-bit value.
