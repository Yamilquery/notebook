# Glossary

## Actor Model

A mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation.

## APNs

## Behavior-Driven Development

A software development methodology in which an application is specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer.

## Binary Protocol

A protocol which is intended or expected to be read by a machine rather than a human being, as opposed to a plain text protocol such as IRC, SMTP, or HTTP. Binary protocols have the advantage of terseness, which translates into speed of transmission and interpretation.

## Blocks

In Ruby, blocks are closures (anonymous functions) that can be passed to many methods.

## Bounded Queue

A queue limited to a fixed number of items. There are several efficient implementations of FIFO queues. An efficient implementation is one that can perform the operations—enqueuing and dequeuing—in O(1) time.

## Brevity

Concise and exact use of words in writing or speech.

## Bytestream

A sequence of bytes. Typically, each byte is from a range of 256 distinct values (octets), and so the term octet stream is sometimes used to refer to the same thing.

## Callbacks

Functions that are executed asynchronously.

## Circular Buffer

A memory allocation scheme where memory is reused (reclaimed) when an index, incremented modulo the buffer size, writes over a previously used location. A circular buffer makes a bounded queue when separate indices are used for inserting and removing data.

## Classpath

A parameter in the JVM or the Java compiler that specifies the location of user-defined classes and packages. The parameter may be set either on the command-line, or through an environment variable.

## CNS

Central Nervous System.

## Comparison Sort

A type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a "less than or equal to" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list.

## Composer

An application-level package manager for the PHP programming language that provides a standard format for managing dependencies of PHP software and required libraries.

## Control Flow

The order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language.

## CORS

## Curry

See: Currying.

## Currying

The process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes just a single argument and returns another function if any arguments are still needed.

## Database normalization

Database normalization, or simply normalization, is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy. Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables without losing information, and then linking the data back together by defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.

## Decorator Pattern

Add responsibilities to objects dynamically; a structural design pattern.

## Deep learning

A branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, composed of multiple non-linear transformations.

## Delta Compression

See: Delta Encoding.

## Delta Encoding

A way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences (deltas) between sequential data rather than complete files; more generally this is known as data differencing.

## DIT

Directory Information Tree.

## Divide & conquer algorithm

An algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type (divide), until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer). The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## Duck Typing

A way to write computer code that doesn't demand that you know what types you are writing about. If it does what you thought it would do, it is good enough. The reason this is called "duck typing" is the duck test: "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck."

## ETL

ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is a process in data warehousing responsible for pulling data out of the source systems and placing it into a data warehouse.

## Fault Tolerance

The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components.

## Functional Tests

Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or side-effects, just the result (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z). They are written to test part of the specification such as, "calling function Square(x) with the argument of 2 returns 4".

## General-Purpose Language

A computer language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain.

## GNU Make

## HSTS

HTTP Strict Transport Security, a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. The HSTS Policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an HTTP response header field named "Strict-Transport-Security". HSTS Policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion.

## Lambda

A closure. More or less identical to PROCS, with a key difference: when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without finishing the calling method.

## Law of Demeter

A given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of "information hiding".

## Profiling

A measure of the relative performance of your application at the code-level. Profiling will capture things like CPU usage, memory usage, time and number of calls per function, as well as capturing a call graph. The act of profiling will impact performance. This differs from benchmarking, as benchmarking is performed externally and will measure the actual performance: what your end-users will see.

## Protected

## Protocol

A defined language machines talk in. Doesn't matter how their brains created or listen to the thoughts, just that the language is agreed upon.

## Queue

## Type introspection

The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.

## UFS

Unionfs is a filesystem service for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD which implements a union mount for other file systems. As an example application of union mounting, consider the need to update the information contained on a CD-ROM or DVD. While a CD-ROM is not writable, one can overlay the CD's mount point with a writable directory in a union mount. Then, updating files in the union directory will cause them to end up in the writable directory, giving the illusion that the CD-ROM's contents have been updated.

## UMT

User multivariate testing, a technique for testing a hypothesis in which multiple variables are modified. The goal of multivariate testing is to determine which combination of variations performs the best out of all of the possible combinations. Websites and mobile apps are made of combinations of changeable elements.
